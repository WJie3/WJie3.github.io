<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm Wang Jie (王洁), a student in the School of Artificial Intelligence at Sun Yat-sen University. I am looking for research collaborations and a Master position starting from 2026 Fall. Please drop me an email if you are interested in my research or just want to chat!

Email: **wangjie928@mail2.sysu.edu.cn**

My current research interests lie in computer vision. My research started from Low-level vision problems(blind face restoration), aiming to build methods with high-quality and generalizability. I am also interested in other low-level vision problems, such as image deblurring, image denoising, and image super-resolution.
